A progress bar library with some simple styling support. The library supports drawing unicode characters for the ends and middle of the progress bar, and each can have their own background and foreground colors applied.

You can also provide intermediate characters so that the bar animates while it fills.  Both the `simple` (ascii only) and `simple_block` (unicode characters) show off this feature.
